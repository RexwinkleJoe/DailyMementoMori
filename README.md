# Daily Memento Mori

A gentle daily reminder to live well — one short item a day.

This is a static website that displays daily Memento Mori content generated by AI. The site is designed to work with GitHub Pages and uses GitHub Actions to automatically generate new content each day.

## Features

- **Daily Content**: Automatically generates a new post each day at midnight Eastern Time
- **Three Content Types**: Alternates between Quotes, Historical Examples, and Exercises
- **Static Site**: Works with GitHub Pages for free hosting
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, mobile-friendly interface
- **Local Storage**: Save posts for later reading

## Setup

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account

2. **Set up GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" section
   - Set source to "GitHub Actions"

3. **Add your OpenAI API key**:
   - Go to repository settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add a new secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key

4. **Enable GitHub Actions**:
   - The workflows will automatically run
   - Daily generation happens at midnight Eastern Time
   - Deploy happens automatically when content is generated

## How it Works

1. **GitHub Actions** runs a scheduled job every day at midnight Eastern Time
2. **Generation Script** calls OpenAI API to create new content
3. **Content Storage** saves the generated post to `storage/posts.json`
4. **Static Site** displays the latest content from the JSON file
5. **Auto-deploy** pushes changes and updates the live site

## Content Types

The system alternates between three types of content:

- **Quote**: Inspirational quotes about mortality and living well
- **Historical Example**: Historical facts or cultural practices about impermanence
- **Exercise**: Practical exercises for reflection and mindfulness

## Local Development

To run locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run a local server
npm run dev

# Generate content manually (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
npm run generate
```

## Manual Content Generation

You can manually trigger content generation by:

1. Going to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Selecting "Daily Generate Post" workflow
3. Clicking "Run workflow"

## Customization

- **Styling**: Edit `index.html` to change the appearance
- **Content**: Modify the prompt in `scripts/generate.js`
- **Schedule**: Adjust the cron schedule in `.github/workflows/daily-generate.yml`
